I mostly followed along with the recorded lecture. I don't recall using any outside resources, but in general, I tend to use stackoverflow and w3schools.

I didn't have any problems, except that the original logic seemed to reset all of the panels to closed regardless of which one is clicked. I added some logic so each panel could open and close independently and also make it possible to check if the panel was already open. If the panel is already open, subsequent clicks will close it.
